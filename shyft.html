					<h5>BACKGROUND</h5>
					<p>Shyft is a platform used primarily for managing shifts, communicating with team members and
						viewing scheduled shifts. While available through a web-app portal, Shyft is primarily used on
						mobile, allowing employees to easily check and maintain their shifts.
					</p>
					<p>As a Brand Associate at a retail shop, I find myself constantly checking Shyft when I need to get
						a shift covered or pick up more shifts. While using this app, however, I've found there to be a
						lot of inconsistencies and dysfunctions, which is where the idea for this project came from!
					</p>

					<br></br>

					<h5>RESEARCH</h5>
					<p>I conducted 25 surveys, from Brand Associates to Managers, to gain a deeper understanding of the
						main problems that people were having with the Shyft App - which allowed me to develop Shyft's
						main pain points and areas of interest.
					</p>
					<p>In my survey, I also included a box where students could fill in their feedback on the Shyft
						mobile app. These insights helped make the decisions on what areas to focus on.
					</p>

					<h5>PROBLEM</h5>
					<p>From my research, I narrowed down the 3 main problems that people seemed to have with the Shyft
						App:
					</p>
					
					<div class="indent">
						<p>1. <b>It’s hard to keep track of our shifts</b>: Because our schedule is usually emailed to us
						and not updated on the app until later, Associates often have to refer to old emails in order to
						view their schedule.
						</p>
						<p>2. <b>Access to see co-workers availability</b>: There is currently no option which allows you to
						see the schedule of other Associates, which makes it difficult and tedious when you need to find
						someone to cover your shift, or would like to trade shifts with someone.
						</p>
						<p>3. <b>App interface is outdated</b>: Feedback from users kept pointing out that the current app
						interface for Shyft not only felt outdated, but that it wasn’t designed visually to best assist
						users.
						</p>
					</div>


					<h5>SKETCHES</h5>
					<p>Some of my first initial sketches were focused on brainstorming lots of ideas for both the flows
						and the components of this app.
					</p>

					<br></br>

					<h5>WIREFRAMES</h5>
					<p>As the designs began shaping up a bit more, I decided to take them into Sketch.
					</p>
					<p>The stylistic choices are focused on reducing the amount of initial options so that it focuses
						primarily on the schedule. However, this structure ended up changing quite a bit as it was
						translated into a higher fidelity.
					</p>

					<br></br>

					<h5>RESULTS</h5>
					<p>Collapsing five tabs into four, I was able to maximize the use of each tab efficiently with the
						introduction of several new key features:
					</p>
					
					<div class="indent">
						<p>1. <b>Easy Schedule Access</b>: Associates can now refer to the schedule and see when they are
						shifted, as well as, given access to view the rest of the team as scheduled.
						</p>
						<p>2. <b>Easier to Post Shifts</b>: One of the annoyances of the original Shyft app was that you had
						to adjust and type in each shift manually before giving it away, which often meant switching
						back and forth between the emailed schedule and Shyft app. I created a feature which allow
						Associates to be able to select from their current shifts, rather than having to manually type
						everything in themselves.
						</p>
						<p>3. <b>Changing availability</b>: In order to change availability, Associates have to go in the
						store and manually change it on the office desktop, which is often slow and laggy. Not only
						that, but Associates have to wait until the next time they are shifted in order to change their
						availability. This new option allows for Associates to submit a new availability without hassle!
