					<h5>PROJECT</h5>
					<p>BrainStation User Experience Final Project</p>

					<h5>ROLE</h5>
					<p>UI/UX Designer</p>

					<h5>DURATION</h5>
					<p>May 2020 - June 2020</p>

					<h5>TOOLS</h5>
					<p>Figma, InVision</p>

					<h6>BACKGROUND</h6>
					<p>This summer, I took BrainStation’s User Experience Design Course. This course taught me a lot about identifying user needs, creating intuitive experiences, as well as developing functional prototypes. For our final project, we were responsible for creating an interactive prototype which demonstrated applications of the concepts taught within the course.
					</p>
					
					<h6>PROBLEM SPACE</h6>
					<p>Before coming into post-secondary, a large part of my high school experience was volunteering! I enjoyed volunteering because it allowed me to not only give back but also gain more experience and connect with others in my community. However, I found that a big road block I had when getting started was searching and applying for volunteer organizations that I had interest in. This is where the idea for my final project came from:
					</p>
					<center><p><i>I’d like to be more involved in my community - what are my volunteer options in my city? How might we provide a digital platform to connect organizations to volunteers and vice versa?
					</i></p></center>

					<h6>USER INTERVIEWS</h6>

					</br>
					<p>From the three interviews that I conducted, I found that the biggest inconvenience when applying to different volunteer positions was keeping track of where they’ve applied and the process of applying to these various volunteer organizations. Oftentimes, it seems that not all positions are available on one webpage which subsequently means one must scroll through several different pages and websites in order to find what they are looking for.
					</p>

					<h6>USER PERSONAS</h6>
					<p>From my interviews, I developed two different user personas. These personas made it easier for me to identify real user profiles, needs, wants and expectations in order to design the best possible experience for them.
					</p>

					<h6>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h6>
					<p>Next, I created an information architecture, which allowed me to create an organization system for my project.

					<h6>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h6>
					<p>After several usability tests, I was able to add different options and changes - such as saving an opportunity for later and creating a more simple map page. This allowed me to simplify the whole layout of the application and overall create a more clear and cohesive user flow.
					</p>
					<p>Despite the class being online due to COVID-19, my 5 weeks at BrainStation taught me a lot about Design Thinking and the importance of using different processes to find unmet needs and opportunities in order to create solutions that matter to people. I was able to learn more about making design accessible and more comprehensive for the user, and put this knowledge to action! A big thank you to my two instructors, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscillaho/">Priscilla Ho</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmgillis/">Sarah Gillis</a> for the passion and guidance with each class!
