					<h5>TEAM</h5>
					<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharonywchen/" target="blank">Sharon Chen,</a> Sarah Dang, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindy-san-86973113a/" target="blank">Cindy San</a></p>

					<h5>ROLE</h5>
					<p>UI/UX Designer</p>

					<h5>DURATION</h5>
					<p>April 10 2020 - April 29, 2020 (Designathon: College + Ocean Agency Creative Jam with Adobe XD)</p>

					<h5>TOOLS</h5>
					<p>Adobe XD, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator</p>

					<h6>BACKGROUND</h6>
					<p>Adobe Creative Jam is an event series where local thought leaders share a behind-the-scenes peek into their processes and projects; meanwhile, teams compete in a tournament that puts their creative skills to the test using Adobe Creative Cloud.
					</p>
					<p>The Ocean Agency Creative Jam is a UX/UI designathon that involves over 250 students formed in 65 teams. Given a design brief, we were challenged to design a mobile app that shows the support for greater environmental action such as combating climate change and protecting the ocean in order to inspire policy, funding and action. Participants were challenged to incorporate Adobe Sign and Photoshop Camera in some unique way in the user flow.
					</p>
					
					<h6>CHALLENGE</h6>
					<p><i>Envision a mobile solution that could enable people around the world to show their support for ocean protection and climate action.
					</i></p>
					<p><i>What if that solution combined a traditional pledge with a fun new way to spread the word, visually, through social media? How would you use electronic signatures to gain support for the cause? How would those supporters spread the word to other like-minded ocean and climate change advocates using Photoshop Camera? 
					</i></p>

					<h6>WIREFRAMES</h6>
					<p>For this mobile app, we wanted a way to gamify it and create an incentive in order for users to come back to the application. At first, it was difficult to find a way to include so many different concepts in just a few screens but we were able to include a mini-game concept through the use of a separate slide up screen function. After bouncing ideas off ideas of one another, we were eventually able to come up with a concrete idea for our app, Ocean Quest!

					<h6>LOGO</h6>
					<p>After figuring out the wireframes and prototyping, we decided to individualize the app by creating a logo. We wanted our application to include aspects of both advocacy and the ocean and so we found a way to incorporate two symbols that we found represented these the best! 
					</p>

					<p>Ocean Quest is a mobile app that allows users to sign petitions and join community wide events, while showing this support for various events and causes on one platform. After users sign up to go to an event, they are able to take photos using Photoshop Camera and upload it on their accounts. They are also able to sign petitions using Adobe Sign and after a number of contributions are made, users are able to earn points and ocean life stickers to add to their oceans, giving users incentive to return to the application and continue showing their support and contribution to ocean conservation!
